<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Breeha Qasim! 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">Final-Year CS Student | Full-Stack Developer | Graphic Designer | Neo4j Certified</h3>

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a final-year Computer Science student at **Habib University** (CGPA: 3.55, 80% Merit Scholarship) passionate about creating solutions where **technology meets design**.  
With experience spanning **full-stack development**, **database systems**, **graph data science**, and **UI/UX design**, I love building products that are both technically robust and visually engaging.  

I’ve worked on everything from digitizing real-world operations at **KVTC** with a custom DBMS to developing immersive OS lab curriculum, leading marketing/design initiatives at startups, and building academic projects in AI, data visualization, and FPGA-based gaming.
