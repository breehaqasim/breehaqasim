<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Breeha Qasim 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">Computer Science Student | Full-Stack Developer | NLP & Graph Data Enthusiast | Neo4j Certified</h3>

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Computer Science student at **Habib University** (CGPA: 3.55, 80% Merit-Based Scholarship) with strong interests in **full-stack development**, **data-driven systems**, and **applied AI**. I enjoy building solutions that combine solid engineering with clean, user-focused design.

My experience spans developing a custom **DBMS for KVTC**, contributing to **Operating Systems lab curriculum design**, and working on academic projects in **Natural Language Processing, Graph Data Science, and algorithms**. I’m particularly interested in how modern software systems scale using structured data, intelligent workflows, and practical AI.
